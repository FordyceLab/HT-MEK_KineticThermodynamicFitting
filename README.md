# Michaelis-Menten fitting, inhibition fitting, data aggregation, and statistics

- assayDataSet_pipeline notebooks contain the code to process the data from individual experiments and perform Michaelis-Menten fits and inhibition fits.
- "process" notebooks allow processing (or reprocessing) of all experiments together in "batch mode", and export the per-experimental summary PDFs that are included in the OSF repository.
- agg* notebooks (aggKinetic, aggInhibition, ...) contain the code necessary to aggregate data from multiple experiments and calculate statistics.
